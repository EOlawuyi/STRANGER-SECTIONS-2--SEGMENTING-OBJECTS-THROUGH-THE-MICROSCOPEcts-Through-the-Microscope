COLOR IMAGE SHARPENING IN PYTHON
kernel = np.array([[0, -1, 0],
[-1, 5, -1],
[0, -1, 0]])
sharpened = cv2.filter2D(image, -1, kernel)

In the above code, we define a sharpening kernel (a 3×3 matrix) with values that emphasize edges. The filter2D function applies this kernel to the image to perform the sharpening operation.

cv2.imshow(‘Original Image’, image)
cv2.imshow(‘Sharpened Image’, sharpened)
cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows()

This code displays both the original and sharpened images using OpenCV’s imshow function. waitKey(0) waits for a keyboard event, and destroyAllWindows closes the image windows when a key is pressed

The Automated Irrigation System automates irrigation across farmlands of any size in order to optimize crop productivity. The Automated Irrigation System software enables Rural and Commercial Farmers to know and visualize the cost and layout of a customized irrigation system prior to purchase, and to see the expected increase in harvest  quantity and profit from utilizing the irrigation system.

RURAL AND COMMERCIAL FARMERS REQUIRING IRRIGATION TO IMPROVE CROP PRODUCTIVITY

TO BOOST, INCREASE AND OPTIMIZE THE FOOD PRODUCTIVITY OF RURAL AND COMMERCIAL FARMERS USING CUSTOMIZED AUTOMATED IRRIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY COLLABORATING WITH OXFAM AND HARVARD UNIVERSITY TO PROPAGATE AND MARKET THE AUTOMATED IRRIGATION SYSTEM (AIS) AND SOFTWARE ACROSS 85 COUNTRIES.

Monitoring units are made up of soil temperature and humidity sensors, soil moisture sensors, Control Boards, Wireless Modules and Battery Packs enclosed in weather-resistant sealed cases. The Monitoring Units continuously measure temperature, humidity, and soil moisture content in the land. If the moisture content drops below a predetermined threshold for the particular crop under production in the land, the Monitoring Units send wireless messages to the Control Units using the Wireless modules. Control Units are made up of Control Boards, Wireless Modules, Battery Packs, and Relay Switches. The Control Units are electrically connected to the valves in the irrigation pipelines. Once the Control Units receive wireless messages from the Monitoring Units requesting irrigation to commence, they electronically activate the pipeline valves along the water flow channel, causing them to open so that irrigation from the water source commences.
When the moisture content rises above a predetermined threshold for the crop, the Monitoring Units send wireless messages to the Control Units requesting irrigation to cease. The Control Units then electronically alter the power supply to the pipeline valves, causing them to close and cease automatic irrigation. This automated irrigation system is customizable and can also be used to upgrade existing drip irrigation systems, surface irrigation systems, and sprinkler irrigation systems to overcome their existing limitations. The unique advantage of this system is that it enables farmers effectively perform multi-cropping on a single plot of land, as each crop is automatically provided the required amount of irrigation water for its optimum development. This is accomplished with the utilization of individual monitoring units embedded within each irrigation block.
The Automated Irrigation System (AIS) Software enables farmers and commercial organizations plan for the installation of irrigation systems on their lands, and helps to promote the need for Irrigation in the Agriculture Industry.
The System and Software has been evaluated by Harvard University and Oxfam, and is set to be marketed across 85 countries.
